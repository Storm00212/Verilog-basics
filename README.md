# Verilog Basics

This repository is a collection of simple Verilog programs to help you learn the basics of the Verilog Hardware Description Language. Each folder in this repository contains a different concept of Verilog with a sample program and its testbench.

## Getting Started

To get started, you will need to have a Verilog simulator installed on your computer. Some popular Verilog simulators include:

*   Icarus Verilog
*   ModelSim
*   Vivado

Once you have a Verilog simulator installed, you can clone this repository to your local machine and start learning!

## How to Use This Repository

Each folder in this repository contains a different concept of Verilog. Each folder has a `README.md` file that explains the concept in detail and provides instructions on how to run the Verilog code.

The folders are organized in the following order:

1.  `1_Introduction`
2.  `2_Dataflow_Modelling`
3.  `3_Gate_Level_Modelling`
4.  `4_Behavioural_Modelling`
5.  `5_Structural_Modelling`
6.  `6_Hierarchical_Modelling`
